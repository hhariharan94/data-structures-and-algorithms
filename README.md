# data-structures-and-algorithms
This repository emphasizes on the 16 main problem solvig patterns.Each pattern will be a complete tool - consisting of data structures, algorithms, and analysis techniques - to solve a specific category of problems. The goal is to develop an understanding of the underlying pattern, so that, we can apply that pattern to solve other problems.

## Pre-requisites
A basic knowledge in JavaScrip as we have used JavaScript to solve the problems and a basic understanding of common data-structures like **_Array, LinkedList, HashMap, Stack, Queue, Heap, and Graph_**. You should also be familiar with _**Recursion and Big-O**_.
